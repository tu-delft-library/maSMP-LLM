You can run any/all of the commands as you like. Note that the Hypothesis annotation previewer assumes a custom mimetype and may not be useful for most Dataverses (contact [QDR](mailto:qdr@syr.edu) for more information). Dataverse 4.11+ is required.\n\nNote that Dataverse installations configured to redirect to S3 storage for file downloads will need to enable CORS at the storage layer as well as the application layer (the latter is enabled by default). (See, for example, [Amazon's CORS configuration guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-cors-configuration.html)).\n\nAlso note that using the commands below means that your installation will automatically start using updated versions of the previewers when the master branch of this repository is updated. We intend to announce upcoming changes on the dataverse-community@google-groups.com mailing list, but if you do not want this behavior, you can download the previewers and host them on your own server, adjusting the curl commands below to reference your local copies.\n",
