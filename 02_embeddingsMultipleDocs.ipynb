By contrast,\\\\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\\\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\\\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\\\\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\\\\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\\\\nyour programs, too.\\\\n\\\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\\\n\\\\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\\\\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\\\\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\\\\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\\\\n\\\\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\\\\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\\\\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\\\\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\\\\nknow their rights.\\\\n\\\\n' metadata={'source': '/Users/ccugutrillague/Documents/outreach/smp-hackthaton/smp-llm/mpdl_collection_raw/MPDL_MPG-Reader_2023-11-28.json', 'language': <Language.PYTHON: 'python'>}\n",

And you must show them these terms so they\\\\nknow their rights.\\\\n\\\\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\\\\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\\\\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\\\\n\\\\n  For the developers\\' and authors\\' protection, the GPL clearly explains\\\\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\\' and\\\\nauthors\\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\\\\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\\\\nauthors of previous versions.\\\\n\\\\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\\\\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\\\\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\\\\nprotecting users\\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\\\\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\\\\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\\\\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\\\\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\\\\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\\\\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\\\\n\\\\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\\\\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\\\\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\\\\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\\\\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\\\\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\\\\n\\\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\\\nmodification follow.\\\\n\\\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\\\n\\\\n  0.

By contrast,\\\\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\\\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\\\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\\\\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\\\\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\\\\nyour programs, too.\\\\n\\\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\\\n\\\\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\\\\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\\\\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\\\\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\\\\n\\\\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\\\\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\\\\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\\\\nor can get the source code.

For both users\\' and\\\\nauthors\\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\\\\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\\\\nauthors of previous versions.\\\\n\\\\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\\\\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\\\\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\\\\nprotecting users\\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\\\\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\\\\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\\\\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\\\\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\\\\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\\\\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\\\\n\\\\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\\\\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\\\\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\\\\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\\\\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\\\\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\\\\n\\\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\\\nmodification follow.\\\\n\\\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\\\n\\\\n  0.

Many of these involve configuring external storage and/or data transfer software. One, whose development was supported by TDL, is a relatively simple application (DVUploader) that can be downloaded by users. It uses the existing Dataverse application programming interface (API) to upload files from a specified directory into a specified Dataset. It can be a useful alternative to the web interface when: \\\\n  * there are hundreds or thousands of files to upload,\\\\n  * when automatic verification of error-free and complete upload of files is desired,\\\\n  * when new files are being generated/added to a directory and Dataverse needs to be updated with just the new files,\\\\n  * uploading of files needs to be automated, e.g. added to an instrument or analysis script or program. \\\\nThe DVUploader does need to be installed and, as a command-line tool, may not be as intuitive as the Dataverse web interface. However, unlike other bulk tools being developed, it will work with any Dataverse installation without any server-side changes. (Since it does upload and store data via Dataverse, it shares the basic performance and performance limitations of Dataverse\\'s web interface. Other tools bypass Dataverse to handle larger data or do not move data from their remote locations and simply reference it in a Dataverse Dataset.) DVUploader can thus be a useful tool for individuals and for Dataverse installations interested in supporting larger numbers of files. \\\\n\",\\n                \"original_header\": \"dataverse-uploader\"\\n            },\\n            \"confidence\": 0.9546070049741632,' metadata={'source': '/Users/ccugutrillague/Documents/outreach/smp-hackthaton/smp-llm/mpdl_collection_raw/MPDL_dataverse-uploader_2023-11-28.json', 'language': <Language.PYTHON: 'python'>}\n",

By contrast,\\\\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\\\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\\\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\\\\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\\\\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\\\\nyour programs, too.\\\\n\\\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\\\n\\\\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\\\\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\\\\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\\\\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\\\\n\\\\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\\\\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\\\\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\\\\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\\\\nknow their rights.\\\\n\\\\n' metadata={'source': '/Users/ccugutrillague/Documents/outreach/smp-hackthaton/smp-llm/mpdl_collection_raw/MPDL_LabCam-Android_2023-11-28.json', 'language': <Language.PYTHON: 'python'>}\n",

And you must show them these terms so they\\\\nknow their rights.\\\\n\\\\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\\\\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\\\\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\\\\n\\\\n  For the developers\\' and authors\\' protection, the GPL clearly explains\\\\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\\' and\\\\nauthors\\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\\\\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\\\\nauthors of previous versions.\\\\n\\\\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\\\\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\\\\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\\\\nprotecting users\\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\\\\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\\\\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\\\\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\\\\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\\\\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\\\\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\\\\n\\\\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\\\\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\\\\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\\\\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\\\\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\\\\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\\\\n\\\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\\\nmodification follow.\\\\n\\\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\\\n\\\\n  0.

You can run any/all of the commands as you like.

Dataverse 4.11+ is required.\\\\n\\\\nNote that Dataverse installations configured to redirect to S3 storage for file downloads will need to enable CORS at the storage layer as well as the application layer (the latter is enabled by default).

By contrast,\\\\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\\\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\\\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\\\\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\\\\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\\\\nyour programs, too.\\\\n\\\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\\\n\\\\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\\\\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\\\\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\\\\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\\\\n\\\\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\\\\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\\\\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\\\\nor can get the source code.

For both users\\' and\\\\nauthors\\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\\\\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\\\\nauthors of previous versions.\\\\n\\\\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\\\\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\\\\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\\\\nprotecting users\\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\\\\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\\\\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\\\\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\\\\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\\\\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\\\\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\\\\n\\\\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\\\\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\\\\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\\\\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\\\\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\\\\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\\\\n\\\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\\\nmodification follow.\\\\n\\\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\\\n\\\\n  0.

By contrast,\\\\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\\\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\\\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\\\\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\\\\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\\\\nyour programs, too.\\\\n\\\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\\\n\\\\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\\\\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\\\\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\\\\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\\\\n\\\\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\\\\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\\\\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\\\\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\\\\nknow their rights.\\\\n\\\\n' metadata={'source': '/Users/ccugutrillague/Documents/outreach/smp-hackthaton/smp-llm/mpdl_collection_raw/MPDL_MPG-Reader-iOS_2023-11-28.json', 'language': <Language.PYTHON: 'python'>}\n",

And you must show them these terms so they\\\\nknow their rights.\\\\n\\\\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\\\\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\\\\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\\\\n\\\\n  For the developers\\' and authors\\' protection, the GPL clearly explains\\\\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\\' and\\\\nauthors\\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\\\\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\\\\nauthors of previous versions.\\\\n\\\\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\\\\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\\\\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\\\\nprotecting users\\' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\\\\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\\\\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\\\\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\\\\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\\\\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\\\\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\\\\n\\\\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\\\\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\\\\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\\\\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\\\\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\\\\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\\\\n\\\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\\\nmodification follow.\\\\n\\\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\\\n\\\\n  0.
