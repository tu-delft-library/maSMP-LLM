                "value": "The Dataverse community has a number of initiatives underway to support upload of larger files (greater than a few GB) and/or large numbers of files. Many of these involve configuring external storage and/or data transfer software. One, whose development was supported by TDL, is a relatively simple application (DVUploader) that can be downloaded by users. It uses the existing Dataverse application programming interface (API) to upload files from a specified directory into a specified Dataset. It can be a useful alternative to the web interface when: \n  * there are hundreds or thousands of files to upload,\n  * when automatic verification of error-free and complete upload of files is desired,\n  * when new files are being generated/added to a directory and Dataverse needs to be updated with just the new files,\n  * uploading of files needs to be automated, e.g. added to an instrument or analysis script or program. \nThe DVUploader does need to be installed and, as a command-line tool, may not be as intuitive as the Dataverse web interface. However, unlike other bulk tools being developed, it will work with any Dataverse installation without any server-side changes. (Since it does upload and store data via Dataverse, it shares the basic performance and performance limitations of Dataverse's web interface. Other tools bypass Dataverse to handle larger data or do not move data from their remote locations and simply reference it in a Dataverse Dataset.) DVUploader can thus be a useful tool for individuals and for Dataverse installations interested in supporting larger numbers of files. \n",
