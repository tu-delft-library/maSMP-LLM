These update messages contain the \n  information needed to perform index updates, thereby keeping GSearch\n  up-to-date with the Fedora repository. \nThe new features in Version 2.0: \n- Added easier configuration, so that you need only edit one file\n  with property values, then run it with ant.\n\t\t\t\t    \n- Added a sortFields parameter to gfindObjects for Lucene, sorting\n  search results as specified, exploiting Lucene classes for sorting.\n  \n- Added optimize options for Lucene indexing. The mergeFactor and maxBufferedDocs\n  properties will affect performance as explained in the Lucene documentation.\n  The optimize action of the updateIndex operation will perform the Lucene method \n  call IndexWriter.optimize(), which merges all segments together into a single segment, \n  optimizing an index for search. The optimize() is no longer called after each updateIndex. \n- Added parameters to the indexDocXslt parameter of the updateIndex operation,\n  enabling the transfer of param values into the indexing stylesheet.\n\t\t\t\t    \n- Added untokenizedFields property to Lucene index.properties files.\n  Adding the property with a list of all untokenized fields will\n  ensure that they all select the appropriate analyzer.\n\t\t\t\t    \n- Added properties snippetBegin and snippetEnd, making highlight code configurable.\n\t\t\t\t    \n- Added property for custom URIResolver used by xslt transformers\n  for basic authorization and SSL,\n  see the example dk.defxws.fedoragsearch.server.URIResolverImpl class.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n- Removed encoding of special characters in indexFields.\n  Snippets now show special characters without modification.\n  Indexes should be reindexed. \n"
